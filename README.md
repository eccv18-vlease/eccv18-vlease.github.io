### TODOs

- [ ] Speaker names instead of Speaker 1, 2, ...
- [ ] Finalize alternatives : Dhruv/Devi, Matthias/Anton, Sanja/Raquel and Boqing/Peter
- [ ] Finalize and add  dates (paper deadline, acceptance notification, camera-ready deadline, anything else?)
- [ ] Finalise and add sponsors
- [ ] Google Analytics
- [ ] A "Latest News/Updates" section, right at the very top?

[Peter's suggestions]

- [x] Navigation bar at top with links to CfP, speakers, schedule, dates, etc.
- [ ] Need some visuals, possibly animated, to reflect both sides of the workshop.
- [x] Move important dates higher (after CfP)
- [ ] Speaker bio photos look distorted. Crop, rather than scale
- [x] Add refs from the proposal doc
